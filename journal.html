	<h4> WEEK 2: SEPT 15th </h4>
	<article> Over this week I have been first focusing on what areas I can improve on for python, I had worked on it very little as a kid and it's been too long since then and I wanted to try and work to get as ahead as I can be. The second and main thing that I have been reflecting on is my (admittedly uncompleted) work for the cart 211 course and the Barnsley fern fractal generator, I've always wanted to approach the problem again with more simple fractal geometry and with more experience in coding, computer science and math. Recently I've discovered a truly amazing YouTube channel called 2dot (I highly recommend ppl check his stuff out), and how he approaches certain problems. His videos on double pendulums and the Mandelbrot set have been making me think about ways I can further explore the realms of abstract mathematics and computer graphics and ways I can try to incorporate them into my creative process. Ive been doing further looking into this area in my personal time and I think it could be something really cool that I could continue working on throughout my course and creative practice.

	<h4> WEEK 3: SEPT 22nd </h4>
	<article> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</article>
